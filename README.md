### Reflections and Comments

1. How did this go, overall?

  - There was a lot for this lab, a lot of new things I was unsure about and I did struggle. But I really wanted to go slower and ask gpt what certain lines mean. I want to be able to understand the concepts that was taught. 
  

2. What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?

 - My code is really long. I don't know how to make it short. Someone at my remo table just made one function for everything and I wish I could understand to do that. 

3. How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
 
- It took me 7 hours to do this assignment. I knew it was gonna take me a long time to do it, because I'm still not quite sure or confident I understand objects yet.
