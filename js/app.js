// create separate JS object literals for each shop location. Each location will be responsible for generating sales data and providing output on an html document. You should be able to perform the following tasks in your javascript file:

// Store the min/max hourly customers, and the average cookies per customer, in object properties.
// Generate a random number of customers that can be used to simulate hourly sales, using Objects/Math/random
// Calculate and store the simulated amounts of cookies purchased for each hour at each location using average cookies purchased and the random number of customers generated.
// Store the results for each location in a separate arrayâ€¦ perhaps as a property of the object representing that location.
// Display the values of each array as unordered lists in the browser.
// Calculating the sum of these hourly totals; your output for each location should look like this:


// Make sure to make each location is its own JavaScript object.

// Location	Min / Cust	Max / Cust	Avg Cookie / Sale
// Seattle	23	65	6.3
// Tokyo	3	24	1.2
// Dubai	11	38	3.7
// Paris	20	38	2.3
// Lima	2	16	4.6
